# Project using Rapidminer and Python 

# Project Description: Supervised Data Mining (Classification)

Supervised Data Mining for Classification. The details of my project are described as follows:

Two Classification Algorithms:

1.	Statsmodel 
2.	sklearn's Linear Regression model along with Random Forest Classifier. 

Dataset: Red Wine Quality Data Set

Using machine learning to determine which physiochemical properties make a wine 'good'!

Name: Red Wine Quality Data Set
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
Input variables:
•	fixed acidity

•	volatile acidity

•	citric acid

•	residual sugar

•	chlorides

•	free sulfur dioxide

•	total sulfur dioxide

•	density

•	pH

•	sulphates

•	alcohol

Output variable: quality (score between 0 and 10)

Data Set Characteristics: Multivariate
Number of Observations: 1599
Number of Attributes/Variables: 12
Missing Values: N/A


# Conclusion


- The precision for the prediction of bad quality wine (0) is 100% where as the precision for prediction of good quality wine (1) is 95%.

- The sklearn's random forest classifier model has the overall precision around 91%, which is slightly greater than that of Logistic Regression for this wine quality prediction.

- It is possible to increase the quality of the wine on the market and prediction of the quality of wine is possible and obtain more profits.



Observed the key factors that determine and affects the quality of the red wine. Wine quality is ultimately a subjective measure. 
The ordered factor 'quality' was not very helpful and to overcome this, so we created another variable called 'rating'.

•	To make predictions of wine quality and any other if required, we trained two models. As seen, the statsmodel and sklearn's Linear Regression model 
along with Random Forest Classifier. The Random Forest Classifier performed marginally better and we decided to stick with it if we had to make any more predictions.

•	The usage of this analysis will help to understand whether by modifying the variables, it is possible to increase the quality of the wine on the market. 
If you can control your variables, then you can predict the quality of your wine and obtain more profits.
